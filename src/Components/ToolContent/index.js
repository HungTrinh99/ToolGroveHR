          Employee turnover rate (also known as attrition rate, or exit rate) is
          an HR metric used to measure the number of employees that leave your
          company over a period (usually a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis).
          <br />
          <br />
          This metric includes voluntary resignations, retirements, dismissals,
          and more during the set period. A high turnover rate is viewed
          negatively for many reasons. It could indicate you have a bad
          workplace culture or show that you have a flawed recruitment process.
          Knowing your turnover rate can benefit your company in many ways. It
